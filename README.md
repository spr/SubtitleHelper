# SubtitleHelper
Making Subtitle Adjusting Easier

## What?

A basic Mac application that allows for GUI editing of SupRipText (.srt) subtitle files.

## Features

- Adjust all time ranges. Offset all entries by a certain amount
- Undo/Redo support

## Goals

1. Make it easy to identify overlaping subtitles, so you can trim to just the important text!
2. Make validation easier, especially on long movies, etc.
3. Help me learn macOS programming and Swift.
